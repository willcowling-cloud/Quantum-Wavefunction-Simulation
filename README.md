# Quantum-Wavefunction-Simulation
A python simulation of a normalised 1D quantum wavefunction. Plotting the real and imaginary parts of the wavefunction, as well as its PDF on the same graph to visualise it. 

Testing numerical methods on our wavefunction:
1. Global Random walk - After testing this and considering the physical meaning behind the nature of this type of walk, I realised that this type of walk is not suitable in this case. This is because ###
